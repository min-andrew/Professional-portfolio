# Professional Portfolio

Created my very own portfolio to showcase all of my different projects and ways to contact me.

## Description

I created every part of this portfolio from scratch by taking advantage of advanced CSS. Some of the advanced CSS includes flexbox, media queries, variables, and various other CSS properties that allowed beautiful styling of the page.
